# Preamble
## The Steam Workshop
Because almost none of the cool gameplay enhancing mods are actually on the nexus, and are instead on the """fantastic""" steam workshop, i've made a super handy collection to compliment this modlist that you can access here:

Do note that you don't need all of these, unlike with skyrim and whatnot the game wont explode into a million peices if you choose not to have a few mods installed.
