# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
# MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL THE DLC FOR THE GAME BOUGHT AND INSTALLED
They're good dlcs tho, so its totally worth it
# SHOVE THE CONTENTS OF 'GAME FOLDER FILES' INTO YOUR DARKEST DUNGEON DIRECTORY
You know, like you'd do for skyrim and fallout
# LAUNCH THE GAME THROUGH MOD ORGANISER ONLY
Doing otherwise will cause the mods to not work, and you to become infertile
# UPON CREATING A NEW GAME, ENABLE THE LUSTIEST LAIR MOD ON THE NEW GAME (if you want to that is)
You can also enable sexy fallen heroes if you want to be kicked directly in the nuts


# The Steam Workshop
Ok so like, there are a surprising amount of good mods on steam, so heres some mods that go well with the list. [Go get em tiger](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2264507822).

# Making the list less painful
In order to make stuff cooler, i have made it so that all the classes can use all 7 skills at once. Also journal pages autosave and you have 36 inventory slots. You're welcome

## New Classes

This list has all the profligates and Tifa Lockheart from [Muscarine](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/330348?tab=user+files)

Also a good majority of them have been reskinned to be far more cute by [Jefuty](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/2034155?tab=user+files)

Underneath the Profligates, you will notice that theres 3 versions of "Jef's MOD Hero Collection". The normal version features almost no lewdness for the profligates, and just makes them cute, the lewd version does. The hardcore edition, however, adds some kinky bdsm stuff to a few of the heroes. If that aint your thing just use Lewd.

## Town People Skins

In this section are reskins for all the town npcs, created by [NIUR](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/64319641?tab=user+files)

All of them are epic and have been installed in two flavours: Normal and Lewd.

Theres also a version made by [Dan](https://www.loverslab.com/profile/1399769-dan-_/) underneath all of those which is a combination of multiple townspeople replacers. If you feel like its a bit much, simply disable it so that the above work instead.

## Minor skins

Most of these were created by [AlcorRadiance](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/91003303?tab=user+files)

All of these can be reinstalled to your tastes rather easily, by right clicking them and clicking reinstall.

There is also a replacer for the skeleton fella in the bottom right and left of your screen in dungeons, with a breast version and a christian and pure non breast version. Both can be customised as you wish

## Monster Skins

Most of these were created by [StalinTheStalin](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/4913083?tab=user+files&BH=0)

Only thing of note is that the crystalline mod has a version with and without futa. Choose what you want, it only effects two enemies anyway.

Theres also a replacer for the skeleton enemies as well made by [AIRHOC](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/91445153?tab=user+files). Personally i find them adorable, hence their inclusion. [ALSO ONE OF THE REPLACED SKELETONS IS SANS](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/650401195411636224/729154961820090429/SPOILER_skeleton_captain.sprite.attack_mace.png)

## Hero Skins

These have been created by [NIUR](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/64319641?tab=user+files), [Xelsword](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/79892533?tab=user+files), and [Jefuty](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/2034155?tab=user+files)

**IMPORTANT**
Due to the way Xelswords skins work, you cannot use them and another one for the same hero at the same time, or else the skin will literally explode


## Lustiest Lair

https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/mods/931

Ok so, this ones a bit of a doozie. Essentially its a massive overhaul to the entire game to make it far more lewd, by way of new bosses, changed ability descriptions, new lewd curios, etc. Only problem is that its like, way too horny (and sometimes a bit buggy). Use it at your own risk

## Save editor

Say what you will, but i find losing heroes really lame. Hence why i've included a nifty little save editor. Below are instructions on how to use it.
1. Back up your saves for the love of god
2. Open the save editor and go to roster
3. Right click, collapse all folds, then expand until you make it to the heroes section
4. hover your mouse over each + to the left of the numbers, to see which hero they represent, then find the ones you want to resurrect
5. Change roster status from 3 to 0
6. Save and exit

Assuming you followed these instructions, you will have either lost your save, or have your heroes back.

# It crashed help
Ok so uhhhh, im just gonna list some things that seem to fix crashing when trying to start a new game. More will be added when people crash and complain to me

Making sure you actually have the musketeer dlc "bought" (its free) on steam and installed

Making sure you have the circus dlc enabled and installed

Listening to the song mentioned above
