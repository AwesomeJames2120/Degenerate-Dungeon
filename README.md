# Preamble
## The Steam Workshop
Because almost none of the cool gameplay enhancing mods are actually on the nexus, and are instead on the """fantastic""" steam workshop, i've made a super handy collection to compliment this modlist that you can access here:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2154264537

Do note that you don't need all of these, unlike with skyrim and whatnot the game wont explode into a million peices if you choose not to have a few mods installed.

### Golly, what are those mods even?
#### Ui Enhancement

Jonathan's Xbox One Prompts - Replaces the ps4 buttons with the better and more christian xbox ones.

#### Gameplay Enhancements

Mods to make the game easier, because good god you'll need em

**3 Trinkets** - Lets you have 3 trinkets per hero.

**Better Trinkets** - Removes all negative effects from vanilla trinkets.

**Faster Combat** - Speeds up attack animations

**Faster Walking** - Speeds up walking from room to room

**Inventory Stack** - Lets items stack higher

**Remove Dungeon Level Restriction** - Lets you bring your higher level heroes to low tier dungeons

**Crimson Curse Buff** - Makes the crimson curse suck less

**Anti-grind & Larger Roster** - Increeces your roster size and makes the chance of higher level heroes showing up higher

**Better Boss Rewards** - Makes boss rewards suck less. Also comes with addons for the dlcs and Sunward Isles

**Nomad Wagon Redone** - Makes the nomad wagon actually useful instead of a thing you look at once and never again.

#### New Lands

**The Sunward Isles** - A japanese themed new land for you to explore. Its really cool. Also has a compatibility patch for The nightmare, and a few addon mods that add more content.

**Beyond Mortality** Adds a bunch of blue eldrich monstrocities to the ruins. Also comes with a cute guy whos good at killing them. Its really cool

#### New Heroes

#### Marvin Sheos mods
None of these have showed up in my game yet so i have no idea if they're good. They probably are though. Just remember to get the shared assets mod as well

#### The Nightmare

A big collection of mods focusing on endgame content. Its pretty cool. (Important note: All these mods require eachother)

**The Nightmare** - The main part. Has a patch for the crimson court if you have it installed

**Better Nightmare Trinkets** Removes all negative effects from the trinkets introduced with this mod

**The Arena** - You know that butchers circus multiplayer thing they added? This is that but singleplayer

## The Actual Modlist

Up in the profile list, you will see an option for "Degenerate Dungeon - No Shame edition" and "Degenerate Dungeon - At least pretend to be pure edition". The main difference between the two is that No shame edition features more exposed titty and coochie.

#### New Classes

This list has all the profligates and Tifa Lockheart from this madlad here: 

https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/330348?tab=user+files. 

Also a good majority of them have been reskinned to be far more cute by this fella here: 
https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/2034155?tab=user+files&BH=0.

At the bottom of the classes section you will notice that theres 3 versions of "Jef's MOD Hero Collection". The normal version features almost no lewdness, the lewd version does. The hardcore edition, however, adds some kinky bdsm stuff to a few of the heroes. If that aint your thing just use Lewd.

#### Town People Skins

In this section are reskins for all the town npcs, created by NIUR:

https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/64319641?tab=user+files

All of them are epic and have been installed in two flavours: Normal and Lewd. Theres also usually a third version of all of these featuring **TENTACLE SEX** but i decided not to install em because they werent very immersive. You can do that yourself.

Theres also a Maid version of the stagecoach npc thats enabled by default, as well as the normal one. The reason for this being that the maid version is adorable. If you would rather switch to regular, just disable it and enable he normal version.

#### Minor skins

Most of these were created by this insane person here:

https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/91003303?tab=user+files

All of these can be reinstalled to your tastes rather easily, by right clicking them and clicking reinstall.

#### Monster Skins

Most of these were created by this epic gamer here:

https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/4913083?tab=user+files&BH=0

Only thing of note is that the crystalline mod has a version with and without futa. Choose what you want, it only effects two enemies anyway.

Theres also a replacer for the skeleton enemies as well. Personally i find them adorable, hence their inclusion. [ALSO ONE OF THE REPLACED SKELETONS IS SANS](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/650401195411636224/729154961820090429/SPOILER_skeleton_captain.sprite.attack_mace.png)

#### Hero Skins

These have been created by NIUR (Linked above), Xelsword, and jefuty:

#### Lustiest Lair

Ok so, this ones a bit of a doozie. Essentially its a massive overhaul to the entire game to make it far more lewd, by way of new bosses, changed ability descriptions, new lewd curios, etc. Only problem is that it probably conflicts a lot with the rest of the guide. Enable it if you want, personally it works fine.
